Title: 10,000 Reasons (Bless The Lord)




Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul
Worship His holy name


Sing like never before
O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing 
Your song again


Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
Your name is great and Your heart is kind


For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come


Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

Worship Your holy name
Lord I'll worship Your holy name

Title: Alabaster




I am broken at Your feet
Like an alabaster jar
Ev'ry piece of who I am
Laid before Your majesty

(And) I will bow my life
At Your feet at Your feet
My lips so lost for words will kiss Your feet
Kiss Your feet

Oh the gravity of You
Draws my soul unto its knees
I will never be the same
I am lost and found in You





Title: All Hail King Jesus




There was a moment 
when the lights went out
When death had 
claimed its victory


The King of Love had 
given up His life
The darkest day in history

There on a cross 
they made for sinners
For every curse 
His blood atoned


One final breath 
and it was finished
But not the end 
we could have known

For the earth began to shake
And the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made
As the heavens roared

All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord 
of Heaven and earth


All hail King Jesus
All hail the Saviour 
of the world

There was a moment
when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through

When all was lost 
He crossed eternity
The King of life
 was on the move

For in a dark cold tomb
Where our Lord was laid
One miraculous breath
And we're forever changed

Let every knee come bow before the King of Kings
Let every tongue confess 
that He is Lord


 Lift up your shout let us
 join with all of Heaven
Singing Holy
Singing Holy
Cry out Holy
Singing Holy

We’ll bow down
even lower
We’ll lift your name 
even higher
We’ll cry out
even louder 
Cause there’s no one like our God  

All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of 
Heaven and earth


All hail King Jesus
All hail the 
Savior of the world

All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of 
Heaven and earth


All hail King Jesus
All hail the 
Savior of the world

All hail King Jesus
All hail King Jesus
All hail King Jesus
All hail King Jesus







Title: All On The Altar




Here's my life
I bring every single piece
All as an offering
Let Your fire rest on me

I won't hold myself back from You
No I won't hold myself back

I lay it all all on the altar
For You are all all I desire

All consuming flame 
burn in me again
Lord have Your way
Have Your way 

You won’t relent
Till You reach the depths of me
My heart is opening
I am Yours and Yours to keep

Spirit fan into flame
This passion in my heart
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours


Spirit breathe 
deep within me
Everything You are
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours





Title: Alpha And Omega




You are Alpha and Omega
We worship You our Lord
You are worthy to be praised

You are Alpha and Omega
We worship You our Lord
You are worthy to be praised

We give You all the glory
We worship You our Lord
You are worthy to be praised

We give You all the glory
We worship You our Lord
You are worthy to be praised





Title: Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)




Amazing grace 
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost 
but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught 
My heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

How precious did 
That grace appear
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone 
I've been set free
My God my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood 
His mercy rains
Unending love 
Amazing grace

The Lord has promised 
good to me
His word my hope secures

He will my shield and 
portion be
As long as life endures

The earth shall soon 
dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine

But God who called me 
here below
Will be forever mine
Will be forever mine
You are forever mine







Title: Amazing Grace




Amazing grace 
how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost 
but now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught 
my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did 
that grace appear
The hour I first believed

The Lord has promised 
good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield 
and portion be
As long as life endures

Through many dangers 
toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought 
me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Yea when this flesh 
and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

When we've been there 
ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days 
to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun





Title: Angels We Have Heard On High




Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing 
o'er the plains

And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous 
strains prolong

What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your 
heavenly song

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth 
the angels sing

Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord 
the newborn King

See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs 
of angels praise

Mary Joseph lend your aid
While our hearts in love
 we raise

Title: Another In The Fire




There's a grace when 
the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas


And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that 
bears the burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning


Either way I won't bow
 to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas


And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire 
oh
(x4)

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin


I can feel the ground 
shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between (us)

There is no other name
But the Name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all


So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas


And should I ever need reminding
How good You have been to me
I’ll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that’s where You’ll be

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin


I can feel the ground 
shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between (us)

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas


And should I ever need reminding
How good You have been to me
I’ll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that’s where You’ll be

I’ll count the joy come every battle
Cause I know that’s where You’ll be





Title: April 30 Ryan Message






Title: Arms Open Wide




Take my life 
I lay it down
At the cross 
where I am found
All I have I give to You my God

Take my hands 
and make them clean
Keep my heart in purity
That I may walk in 
all You have for me

Woah-oh-oh-oh 
here I stand
Arms open wide
Woah-oh-oh-oh 
I am Yours
And You are mine (Jesus)

Take my moments 
and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only for You oh God

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

My whole life is Yours 
I give it all
Surrendered to Your Name
And forever I will pray
Have Your way 
have Your way
(REPEAT)





Title: At The Cross (Love Ran Red)




There's a place
Where mercy reigns 
And never dies

There's a place
Where streams of grace 
Flow deep and wide

Where all the love 
I've ever found
Comes like a flood 
Comes flowing down

At the cross at the cross
I surrender my life
I'm in awe of You 
I'm in awe of You

Where Your love ran red 
And my sin washed white
I owe all to You 
I owe all to You

There's a place
Where sin and shame 
Are powerless

Where my heart
Has peace with God 
And forgiveness

Here my hope is found
Here on holy ground
Here I bow down 
Here I bow down

Here arms open wide
Here You saved my life
Here I bow down
   Here I bow 





Title: Away In A Manger (Mueller)




Away in a manger 
no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head


The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing the Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus 
no crying He makes


I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh

Be near me Lord Jesus 
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever 
and love me I pray


Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there





Title: Wild & Crazy




Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God





Title: Beautiful




I see Your face in ev'ry sunrise
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say
You're beautiful

I see Your power in 
the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright


We are amazed in 
the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who You are
You're beautiful

You're beautiful

I see You there 
hanging on a tree
You bled and then You died
And then You rose 
again for me

Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home
You're beautiful

You're beautiful
Let's sing it out

When we arrive at 
eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more


We'll enter in as the
 wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we'll sing
You're beautiful

Oh You're beautiful

I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful You're beautiful
I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful You're beautiful


I see Your face
I see Your face
I see Your face You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful





Title: Before The Throne Of God Above




Before the throne 
of God above
I have a strong 
and perfect plea

A great High Priest 
whose name is Love
Who ever lives 
and pleads for me

My name is graven 
on His hands
My name is written 
on His heart

I know that while 
in heaven He stands

No tongue can bid me 
thence depart
No tongue can bid me 
thence depart

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Praise the One
Risen Son of God


When Satan tempts 
me to despair
And tells me of 
the guilt within

Upward I look 
and see Him there
Who made an end 
to all my sin

Because the sinless 
Saviour died
My sinful soul 
is counted free

For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him 
and pardon me
To look on Him 
and pardon me

Behold Him there 
the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness

The great unchangeable 
I Am
The King of glory 
and of grace

One with Himself 
I cannot die
My soul is purchased 
with His blood

My life is hid 
with Christ on high
With Christ my Saviour 
and my God
With Christ my Saviour 
and my God

I bow before 
the cross of Christ
And marvel at 
this love divine

God's perfect Son 
was sacrificed
To make me righteous 
in God's eyes

This river's depths 
I cannot know
But I can glory in its flood

The Lord Most High has bowed down low

And poured on me His glorious love
And poured on me His glorious love





Title: Belong To You




Oh You called me
out of darkness
You silence every lie
And no other voice 
will define me
I belong to You 
I belong to You

By Your blood 
I've been adopted
I've taken on Your name
And I need to be reminded
That I belong to You 
I belong to You

And the enemy can’t take what I have
Change who I am 
I belong to You
You know the enemy can’t take what I have
Change who I am 
I belong to You

Greater are You who's in me
Than he who's in the world
The words You have spoken
Are stronger than the curse

And the enemy can’t take what I have
Change who I am 
I belong to You

You know the enemy can’t take what I have
Change who I am 
I belong to You

I belong to You 
I belong to You
No one can take from me
 my destiny
I belong to You





Title: Blessed Be Your Name




Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
When I'm found
 in the desert place

Though I walk
 through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name

Ev’ry blessing You pour out I’ll
Turn back to praise

When the darkness 
closes in Lord
Still I will say

Blessed be 
the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be 
The name of the Lord
Blessed be 
Your glorious name

Blessed be Your name
When the sun's 
Shining down on me

When the world's 
All as it should be
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
On the road 
Marked with suffering

Though there's pain
In the offering
Blessed be Your name

You give and take away
You give and take away

My heart will choose to say
Lord blessed be Your name





Title: Boldly I Approach (The Art of Celebration)




By grace alone 
somehow I stand
Where even angels 
fear to tread

Invited by redeeming love
Before the throne 
of God above

He pulls me close with 
nail-scarred hands
Into His everlasting arms

When condemnation 
grips my heart
And Satan tempts 
me to despair

I hear the voice 
that scatters fear
The Great I Am 
the Lord is here

O praise the One 
who fights for me
And shields my soul eternally

Boldly I approach Your throne
Blameless now 
I'm running home

By Your blood I come welcomed as Your own
Into the arms of majesty

Behold the bright 
and risen Son
More beauty than 
this world has known

I'm face to face 
with Love Himself
His perfect spotless righteousness

A thousand years 
A thousand tongues
Are not enough to sing 
His praise

This is the art of celebration
Knowing we're free from condemnation

O praise the One 
Praise the One
Who made an end 
To all my sin





Title: Break Every Chain




All sufficient sacrifice
So freely given such a price
Bought our redemption Heaven's gates
Swing wide

There is power in the 
name of Jesus
There is power in the 
name of Jesus
There is power in the 
name of Jesus

To break every chain
Break every chain 
break every chain

There's an army rising up
(REPEAT)
To break every chain
Break every chain 
break every chain
(REPEAT)

There's power in the name Jesus
Jesus
Jesus





Title: Breathe




This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence 
living in me


This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

And I I'm desperate for You
And I I'm lost without You

This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe





Title: Broken Vessels (Amazing Grace)




All these pieces
Broken and scattered
In mercy gathered
Mended and whole


Empty handed
But not forsaken
I've been set free
I've been set free

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Oh I once was lost
But now I am found
Was blind but now I see

Oh I can see You now
Oh I can see the
 love in Your eyes
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life

You take our failure
You take our weakness
You set Your treasure
In jars of clay


So take this heart Lord
I'll be Your vessel
The world to see
Your life in me





Title: Build My LIfe




Worthy of every song
 we could ever sing
 Worthy of all the praise
 we could ever bring
 

Worthy of every breath
 We could ever breathe 
We live for you

Jesus the name 
Above every other name 
Jesus the only one 
That could ever save 

Worthy of every breath 
We could ever breathe
We live for you
We live for you


Holy
 There is no one like You 
There is none beside You Open up my eyes in wonder
 

Show me who You are 
And fill me
 With Your heart 
And lead me
 In Your love to those
Around me

I will build my life
Upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

I will put my trust
 In You oh Lord
And I will not be shaken 





Title: Build Your Kingdom Here


Come set Your rule and reign
In our hearts again
Increase in us we pray
Unveil why we're made

Come set our hearts 
Ablaze with hope
Like wildfire in our very souls

Holy Spirit come 
Invade us now

We are Your church
We need Your pow'r in us

We seek Your kingdom first
We hunger and we thirst
Refuse to waste our lives
For You're our joy and prize

To see the 
captives' hearts released
The hurt 
The sick 
The poor 
At peace

We lay down our lives for heaven's cause

We are Your church
We pray revive this earth

Build Your kingdom here
Let the darkness fear
Show Your mighty hand
Heal our streets and land

Set Your church on fire
Win this nation back
Change the atmosphere

Build Your kingdom here 
We pray

Unleash Your kingdom's pow'r
Reaching the near and far
No force of hell can stop
Your beauty changing hearts

You made us for 
much more than this
Awake the kingdom
 seed in us

Fill us with the strength and love of Christ

We are Your church
We are the hope on earth

Title: Call it Grace




It’s the light that pierces through You
to the darkest hidden place

It knows your deepest secrets 
but it never looks away 

It’s the gentle hand 
that hold you
from the judgement 
of the crowd 

When you stand 
before them guilty 
and you’ve got no way out

Some may call it foolish and impossible 
but for every heart it rescues it’s a miracle

It’s nothing less than scandalous 
this love that took our place

Just call it what it is 
call it grace

It’s the breath that’s breathing new life
Into what we 
thought was dead

It’s the favour that 
takes orphans 
placing crowns upon their heads

It’s the hope 
for our tomorrow 
the rock on which we stand

Its a strong 
and mighty fortress
even hell can’t stand against 

Amazing, Unshaking
this is grace, this is grace 

Unchanging, Unfailing 
this is grace, this is grace

Some may call it foolish and impossible
but for every heart it rescues it’s a miracle

It’s nothing less than scandalous 
that Jesus took our place

Just call it what it is
just call it what it is
call it grace







Title: Call Upon The Lord




We need no other 
Hiding place
Our hope is safe 
Within Your name

This we know 
This we know 

You promised 
Never to forsake
What You began 
You will sustain

I will call upon the Lord
For He alone 
Is strong enough to save

Rise Your shackles 
Are no more
For Jesus Christ 
Has broken every chain

All of the heavens
 and the earth
Announce the fullness 
of Your worth

And every enemy will flee
As we declare Your victory

Jesus' name will 
Break every stronghold
Freedom is ours when 
We call His name

Jesus' name 
Above every other
All hail the power 
of Jesus' name







Title: Came To My Rescue




Falling on my 
knees in worship
Giving all I am 
to seek Your face
Lord all I am is Yours

My whole life I 
place in Your hands
God of mercy humbled
 I bow down
In Your presence
 at Your throne

I called 
You answered
And You came
 to my rescue
And I wanna be 
where You are

In my life be lifted high
In our world be lifted high
In our love be lifted high

What was stolen 
You brought back to us

Our Champion 
You're strong in us
The debt we owe 
You paid in full

The One in whom we belong
We'll lift our voice 
join Your song
We were orphaned now forever Yours

We will shout it out 
from the mountaintops
That our God is good 
He has overcome

Let all the earth 
every tribe and tongue
We will sing it out 
He has overcome





Title: Children Of Light




When Your love came 
Into the darkness
You sent the light of the Son
You sent the light of the Son

Wake up open your eyes
No longer dead we are alive

Rise up children of light
Open the doors go let it shine

Woah (4X)

There is freedom
In Your Kingdom
For You Jesus 

We will be dancing
Forever Your joy is our song
Forever Your joy is our song

Song for the broken 
Let it shine

Into the shadows
Let it shine

Hope for the whole world
Let it shine
Let it shine

Title: Clean




I see shattered 
You see whole
I see broken 
but You see beautiful

And You’re helping me 
to believe
You’re restoring me 
piece by piece

There’s nothing too dirty
That You can’t make worthy
You wash me in mercy
I am clean


There’s nothing too dirty
That You can’t make worthy
You wash me in mercy
I am clean

What was dead 
now lives again
My heart's beating beating inside my chest


I’m coming alive 
with joy and destiny
‘Cause You’re restoring me piece by piece

Washed in the blood 
of Your sacrifice
Your blood flowed red 
and made me white
My dirty rags are purified
I’m clean

I am  clean
I’m clean
You make - You wash me
Clean





Title: Climb




I lean not on my own understanding
My life is in the hands of the Maker of heaven

something beautiful out of me

 There’s nothing I hold on to
(Repeat)

 I will climb this mountain 
with my hands wide open
(Repeat)

Who gladly choose You now

Title: Cornerstone




My hope is built 
on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood 
and righteousness

I dare not trust 
the sweetest frame
But wholly trust 
in Jesus' Name

Christ alone Cornerstone
Weak made strong 
in the Saviour's love


Through the storm 
He is Lord
Lord of all

When darkness seems 
to hide His face
I rest on His 
unchanging grace

In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds 
within the veil
My anchor holds 
within the veil

He is Lord, Lord of all

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then 
in Him be found

Dressed in His 
righteousness alone
Faultless stand 
before the throne





Title: Countdown


 







Title: Crown Him (Majesty)




Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the 
heav'nly anthem drowns
All music but its own

Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him 
as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Majesty Lord of all
Let ev'ry throne 
before Him fall

The King of kings
O come adore
Our God who reigns forevermore 

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious 
in the strife
For those He came to save

His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

All hail Redeemer hail
For He has died for me
His praise and glory 
shall not fail
Throughout eternity

Title: Days of Elijah 


 

 These are the days of Elijah, Declaring the Word of the Lord

And these are the days of Your servant Moses Righteousness being restored

And though these are days of great trials 
Of famine and darkness and sword

Still we are the voice in the desert crying 
Prepare ye the way of the Lord  

Behold He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call

Lift your voice it’s the year of Jubilee 
Out of Zion’s hill salvation comes 

And these are the days of Ezekiel 
The dry bones becoming as flesh 

And these are the days of Your servant David
Rebuilding a temple of praise

And these are the days of the harvest 
The fields are white in the world 

And we are the labourers in Your vineyard 
Declaring the Word of the Lord 

There’s no god like Jehovah  





Title: Death Where Is Your Sting




For God so loved the world He gave His son

To bear the weight of sin 
He bled for us 

From Heaven's highest place He took the fall
And there was just one life laid down for all

Death where is your sting
Grave where is your victory
He's alive
He's alive
He is risen

Behold the vacant tomb that held our Lord


That grave became the stage for Heaven's glory

Behold the Risen King 
in open skies
He is the Resurrection 
He is the Life

Death where is your sting
Grave where is your victory
He's alive
He's alive
He is risen

No weapon formed against
us will prosper
The gates of hell won't stand


Your Church will rise from glory to glory
In the name of Jesus

Death where is your sting
Grave where is your victory
He's alive
He's alive
He is risen

Title: Desert Song




This is my prayer 
in the desert
When all that's 
within me feels dry


This is my prayer in my hunger and need
My God is the
 God who provides

This is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain


There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord 
through the flame

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain


I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and 
He is here

This is my prayer in the battle
When triumph is 
still on its way


I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

All of my life in ev’ry season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship
(REPEAT)

This is my prayer 
in the harvest
When favour and 
providence flow


I know I'm filled 
to be emptied again
The seed I've received 
I will sow





Title: Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble 


 

 Did you feel the 
mountains tremble
Did you hear the oceans roar 


 When the people 
rose to sing of
Jesus Christ the risen One 

 Did you feel the 
people tremble
Did you hear the singers roar 

 When the lost began to sing of Jesus Christ 
the saving One

 And we can see that God You’re moving 
A mighty river through 
the nations 
And young and old
 will turn to Jesus 


 Fling wide you 
heavenly gates 
Prepare the way 
of the risen Lord 

 Open up the doors and let the music play
Let the streets 
resound with singing 


Songs that bring Your hope 
Songs that bring Your joy 
Dancers who dance 
upon injustice 

 Do you feel the 
darkness tremble
When all the saints 
join in one song 


And all the streams 
flow as one river 
To wash away our brokenness  

 And here we see that God You’re moving 
A time of jubilee is coming 
When young and old return to Jesus 


Fling wide you heavenly gates 
Prepare the way 
of the risen Lord  





Title: Do It Again




Walking around these walls
I thought by now they'd fall
But you have never 
failed me yet


Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For you have never 
failed me yet

Your promise still stands
Great is your faithfulness
Faithfulness


I'm still in your hands
This is my confidence
You've never failed me yet

I know the night won't last
Your word will come to pass
My heart will sing
 your praise again


Jesus you're still enough
Keep me within your love
My heart will sing 
your praise again

I've seen you move
You move the mountains
And I believe
I'll see you do it again


You made a way
Where there was no way
And I believe
I'll see you do it again

You've never failed me yet
I never will forget
You've never failed me yet
I never will forget





Title: Draw Me Close




Draw me close to You 
never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend
You are my desire no one else will do

'Cause nothing else could 
take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find the way 
bring me back to You

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near

Help me know You are here





Title: Endless Ocean




You are endless ocean bottomless sea
You are endless ocean bottomless sea





Title: Endlessly




It's already been done
You can't add to His blood

It was once for all 
the Father gave His Son

Forever we are changed
By the miracle of grace

Throughout history the Father's light remains

Praises rise endlessly
We lay our lives 
before the King

Who was and Who is
His love will always be
The Hope for all eternity

We've only just begun
To see all of Heaven come

Every fear will bow at the Father's perfect love

Your kingdom is at hand
And the gates of hell 
won't stand

Now in victory 
we lift our song again

Open up the doors
We are ready we are ready

We're crying out for more
In Your presence 
we come alive

We are ready we are ready
We are ready we are ready

Every good and perfect gift

There’s nothing I could ever want, apart from you, apart from you

You’re the Father to the fatherless
You’re the Shepherd to the shepherd-less
You’re the peace to the restless

The redeemer of my sinfulness
You’re the order in my chaos
You are, You are
You are, You are

31He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
Matthew 13:31 (NIV)

32Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”
Matthew 13:32 (NIV)

33He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”
Matthew 13:33 (NIV)

I surrender, I surrender all 
I surrender, I surrender all

Lord take control

A never ending story
Of love that's always
chasing me

We'll give our lives in sacrifice
Until You come again

Forever forever

Title: Forever (We Sing Hallelujah)




The moon and stars 
they wept
The morning sun was dead

The Savior of the world 
was fallen

His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us

The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away

The Son of God was laid 
in darkness

A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged

The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away

His perfect love 
could not be overcome

Now death 
where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever He is glorified
Forever He is lifted high

And Forever He is risen
He is alive and He is alive

We sing hallelujah 
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah the Lamb has overcome

We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah

And now death 
where is your sting

Our resurrected King 
has overcome
He's overcome oh





Title: Forever Reign




You are good 
You are good
When there's nothing 
good in me

You are love 
You are love
On display for all to see

You are light 
You are light
When the darkness closes in

You are hope 
You are hope
You have covered all my sin

You are peace 
You are peace
When my fear is crippling

You are true 
You are true
Even in my wandering

You are joy 
You are joy
You're the reason that I sing

You are life 
You are life
In You death has lost its sting

I'm running to Your arms
I'm running to Your arms
The riches of Your love will always be enough

Nothing compares 
to Your embrace
Light of the world 
forever reign

You are more 
You are more
Than my words will ever say

You are Lord 
You are Lord
All creation will proclaim

You are here
You are here
In Your presence I'm made whole

You are God 
You are God
Of all else I'm letting go

My heart will sing 
No other Name
Jesus 
Jesus

 A thousand times I’ve failed Still Your mercy remains and Should I stumble again I’m caught in Your grace

The art of losing myself in bringing You praise

Consume me from

And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise 
From the inside out  





Title: Get Your Hopes Up




I see the sun
 waking up the morning
Reviving dreams


I feel the wind on my back with promise
Reminding me

There's a garment of praise for heaviness
There's a new song burning inside my chest


I'm living in the 
goodness that He brings

Get your hopes up
Lift your head up
Let your faith arise


Get your hopes up
Our God is for us
He's brought us back to life

To soften my heart 
To break me apart

To open my eyes 
To see that You’re shaping my Life

 Give me faith to trust what You say 
That You’re good and Your love is great 
I’m broken inside 
I give You my life 

I need You 
To soften my heart 
To break me apart 
I need You 
To pierce through the dark 
And cleanse every part of me 

 I may be weak 
Your spirit strong in me 
My flesh may fail
My God You never will

Title: Glorious Day (Living He Loved Me)


One day when heaven was filled with His praises

One day when sin was as black as could be

Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin

Dwelt among men my example is He

The Word became flesh
And the light shined among us
His glory revealed

Living He loved me 
Dying He saved me
Buried He carried my 
sins far away

Rising He justified 
freely forever

One day He's coming
O glorious day 
Glorious day

One day they led Him up Calv'ry's mountain

One day they nailed Him to die on a tree

Suffering anguish despised and rejected
Bearing our sins my Redeemer is He

The hand that healed nations
Stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer

One day the stone rolled away from the door

Then He arose over death He had conquered
Now is ascended my Lord evermore

Death could not hold Him
The grave could not keep Him
From rising again

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine

Wonderful day 
my beloved one bringing
My Savior Jesus is mine

O glorious day glorious day
O glorious day





Title: Glorious Day




I was buried 
beneath my shame
Who could carry 
that kind of weight


It was my tomb
 'til I met You

I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb 'til I met You

You called my name (and)
I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness 
into Your glorious day


You called my name (and)
 I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness 
into Your glorious day

Now Your mercy 
has saved my soul
Now Your freedom 
is all that I know


The old made new Jesus when I met You

I needed rescue 
my sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory


I needed shelter 
I was an orphan
Now You call me a 
citizen of Heaven

When I was broken 
You were my healing
Now Your love is the air
 that I'm breathing


I have a future 
my eyes are open
(cause) when you 
called my name 
 I ran out of that grave

Out of the darkness 
into Your glorious day






Title: Glorious Day




I was buried beneath 
my shame
Who could carry that 
kind of weight


It was my tomb 
'til I met You


I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb 
'til I met You

You called my name
I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness into Your glorious day


Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all that I know


The old made new Jesus when I met You

For the Lord our God is able

For the Lord our God is able
For the Lord our God is able





Title: God Of Amazing




Every moment 
Here every gathering
Stands to testify 
to this one thing
You're amazing

We are miracles 
Standing side by side
Once our hearts were dead but You've made us alive
You're amazing

Every story and life 
You've saved
Puts Your glory on display

You're the God of amazing
You're the God of what 
Cannot be explained

You're the God who
delights to be more
Than we've ever hoped for
There's no end to the power of Your name

You're the God of astounding
Far beyond our impossibilities

For the things not yet seen
Lord we dare to believe
You're the God of amazing

Far too long we've
 Settled for so much less

But You call us to stand next to You and expect
The amazing

For Your Kingdom 
And for Your fame
Put Your glory on display

Oh we're watching and waiting united and praying
For Heaven to fall upon us

Redeem and restore 
Let our hope be reborn
As we stand with You Victorious

Title: Good Good Father




 Love so undeniable, 
I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable, 
I can hardly think

Oh, I’ve heard 
a thousand stories
of what they think Your like 

But I’ve heard the 
tender whisper
of love in the dead of night 

 You tell me, 
that Your pleased
and that I’m never alone

 You’re a good, good Father, 
It’s who You are
It’s who You are,
It’s who You are

 And I’m loved by You, 
It’s who I am
It’s who I am, 
It’s who I am

I’ve seen many searching for answers far and wide

But I know we’re all 
Searching for answers
Only You provide

Because You know, 
Just what we need 
Before we, say a word

 You are perfect 
in all of your ways
 You are perfect 
in all of your ways 
You are perfect 
in all of your ways to us

 Love so undeniable, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable, 
I can hardly think

 As you call me deeper still
 As you call me deeper still

  As you call me deeper still
Into love, love, love…

Everywhere I turn I see

Chasing after me

More than I could 
dare to dream
I have tasted 
I have seen


The kindness of Your heart
The kindness of Your heart


Even in my darkest day
God Your goodness 
will remain
It's just who You are
 it's just who You are

Ever before me
Ever behind me
Every day of my life

We lift up the name of 
Jesus!

Title: Hands




skin

 The hands that 
touched the leper’s skin
and made him whole again
The hands that
 formed the galaxies
So tenderly formed you and me

The hands that humbly
washed the feet
Of the one who
 would betray him


Are reaching out
with holy grace
He came not to condemn,
but to save

The hands that healed
every broken body 
that they touched
Were broken by two nails
upon that great unbroken cross

I will lift my hands in praise
and adoration of the One
Who triumphed over death
in You the victory is won

The very same hands
that hold the ocean wide
I will hold on 
to daily be my guide

The same power that raised
Christ from the grave
Is filling me with 
new life every day

The hands that stretched 
over the storm
and made the waters still
Can calm the storm
within my soul

I will rest in your Shalom
My hiding place 
is in you alone





Title: Happy Day




The greatest day in history
Death is beaten 
You have rescued me
Sing it out Jesus is alive

The empty cross 
The empty grave
Life eternal 
You have won the day
Shout it out Jesus is alive
He's alive

And oh happy day happy day
You washed my sin away

Oh happy day happy day
I'll never be the same
Forever I am changed

When I stand in that place
Free at last 
Meeting face to face
I am Yours 
Jesus You are mine

Endless joy perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate Jesus is alive
He's alive

Oh what a glorious day
What a glorious way
That You have saved me

And oh what a glorious day
What a glorious name

What a glorious glorious day
I'll never be the same





Title: Hark The Herald Angels Sing (Mendelssohn)




Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth 
and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Christ by highest 
heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord

Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of 
the Virgin's womb

Veiled in flesh the 
Godhead see
Hail th'incarnate Deity
Pleased as man 
with men to dwell
Jesus our Emmanuel

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hail the heav'n-born 
Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness

Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing 
in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man 
no more may die

Born to raise 
the sons of earth
Born to give 
them second birth

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King





Title: He Is Faithful




I have heard a sound 
coming on the wind
Changing hearts and minds 
healing brokenness

I feel a generation 
breaking through despair
I hear a generation 
full of faith declare

And our song it will be
Out of the darkness 
we will rise and sing

He is faithful He is glorious
And He is Jesus 
and all my hope is in Him

He is freedom 
He is healing right now
He is hope and joy love and peace and life

I have seen a light 
like the break of dawn
Giving blind men sight 
and letting lame men walk

I see a generation 
with resurrection life
We are a generation 
filled with the power of Christ

He has paid the highest price
He has proven His great love for us

We will praise Him 
with our lives
And proclaim our love for Him
And proclaim our love for Him

We lift up the name of Jesus
(repeat)





Title: He Shall Reign Forevermore




In the bleak mid-winter
All creation groans
For a world in darkness
Frozen like a stone

Light is breaking
In a stable for a throne

He shall reign forevermore forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore forevermore

Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and 
Lord of lords
And He shall reign forevermore forevermore

If I were a wise man
I would travel far
If I were a shepherd
I would do my part

But poor as I am
I will give to Him my heart

Here within a manger lies 
the One
Who made the starry skies
This baby born for sacrifice
Christ the Messiah

Into our hopes into our fears
The Savior of the 
world appears
The promise of eternal years
Christ the Messiah





Title: Heal Our Land




You take our lives
Flawed yet beautiful

Restore refine

kingdom comes
And when at last You call
We'll rise to worship 
You alone

So God we pray to You
Humble ourselves again
Lord would You hear our cry
Lord will You heal our land

That ev'ry eye will see
That ev'ry heart will know
The One who took our sin
The One who died and rose

More than enough for me





Title: Heaven




Teach me how to listen
I want to know Your voice

Show me how to wade through
Living in the natural
Rise above the noise

Teach me how your heart beats
Tether it to mine

The surgery is worth it
Get below the surface
open up my eyes

I wanna see Heaven
so let Your Kingdom come
I wanna see Heaven
so let your Kingdom come

If faith can wake 
the dead man
and hope can split the sea

then help me remember
the Kingdom of Heaven
is living in me

If death
it was no match for
the resurrected King

then help me remember
that Heaven is alive
and it’s living in me

I feel the tides are changing
I feel the walls are falling down

I feel the darkness shaking
We’re calling up salvation now

Heaven is open
so let Your Kingdom come
Yes Heaven is open
so let Your Kingdom come

Title: How Can It Be




I am guilty
Ashamed of what I've done what I've become

These hands are dirty
I dare not lift them up
To the Holy One

You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains You overcome

You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free 
How can it be yeah
How can it be

I've been hiding
Afraid I've let You down
Inside I doubt

That You could love me
But in Your eyes
There's only grace now

Though I fall 
You can make me new
From this death 
I will rise with You

Oh the grace 
reaching out for me
How can it be
How can it be





Title: How Deep The Father's Love For Us




How deep the Father's 
love for us
How vast beyond all measure

That He should give 
His only Son
To make a wretch 
His treasure

How great the pain 
of searing loss
The Father turns 
His face away

As wounds which mar 
the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders

Ashamed I hear 
my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that 
held Him there
Until it was accomplished

His dying breath has 
brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts no power no wisdom

But I will boast in 
Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from 
His reward
I cannot give an answer

But this I know 
with all my heart
His wounds have paid 
my ransom





Title: How Great Is Our God




The splendor of the King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
And trembles at His voice

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see how great
How great is our God

And age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the End
Beginning and the End

The Godhead three in one
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God





Title: How Great Thou Art




O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Thy hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy pow'r thru'out
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

And when I think
That God His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

That on the cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died
To take away my sin

When through the woods
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees

When I look down
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook
And feel the gentle breeze

When Christ shall come
With shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God how great Thou art

How Great Thou Art
How Great Thou Art





Title: How He Loves


He is jealous for me
loves like a hurricane
I am a tree 

Bending beneath
The weight of His 
wind and mercy

When all of a sudden 

I am unaware of
These afflictions
 eclipsed by glory

I realize just how
 beautiful You are

And how great 
Your affections are for me

Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so

He loves us
Oh how He loves us

Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves 

We are His portion and 
He is our prize

Drawn to redemption 
by the grace in His eyes

If grace is an ocean
 we're all sinking

So Heaven meets earth
Like an unforeseen kiss

And my heart turns violently inside of my chest 

I don't have time to 
maintain these regrets

When I think about
 the way that 





Title: How He Loves


He is jealous for me
loves like a hurricane
I am a tree 

Bending beneath
The weight of His 
wind and mercy

When all of a sudden 
I am unaware of
These afflictions
 eclipsed by glory

I realize just how
 beautiful You are
And how great 
Your affections are for me

Oh, how He loves us so,
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so

He loves us
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves

We are His portion and 
He is our prize
Drawn to redemption 
by the grace in His eyes

If grace is an ocean
 we're all sinking

So Heaven meets earth
Like an unforeseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest

I don't have time to 
maintain these regrets
When I think about
 the way that





Title: How Majestic




Without a word
The mountains speak
The song 
that all creation sings

The painted skies
The sun and stars

The heavens tell 
how great You are
The heavens tell 
how great You are

How majestic is Your name
How majestic is Your name

Jesus wonderful powerful
You're the Lord of all
How majestic is Your name

A rugged cross
A humble King
How beautiful the mystery

That love would bleed from majesty

All rise all rise 
in highest praise
Your name will reign through all eternity

Our hope our strength 
our victory
We bow down down at Your feet





Title: I Am Not Alone




When I walk 
Through deep waters
I know that You 
Will be with me

When I'm standing in the fire
I will not be overcome

Through the valley 
of the shadow
I will not fear

I am not alone
I am not alone

You will go before me
You will never leave me

In the midst of deep sorrow
I see Your light 
Is breaking through

The dark of night 
Will not overtake me
I am pressing into You

Lord You fight my ev'ry battle
And I will not fear

You amaze me redeem me
You call me as Your own


You're my strength 
You're my defender
You're my refuge in the storm

Through these trials 
You've always been faithful
You bring healing to my soul

Title: I Will Rise




There's a peace 
I've come to know

Though my heart 
and flesh may fail

There's an anchor for my soul
I can say it is well

Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed

The victory is won
He is risen from the dead

I will rise when 
He calls my name
No more sorrow no more pain

I will rise on eagle's wings
Before my God 
fall on my knees

And rise, I will rise 
I will rise

There's a day that's 
drawing near

When this darkness
 breaks to light

And the shadows disappear
And my faith shall be my eyes

And I hear the voice of 
many angels sing
Worthy is the Lamb

And I hear the cry of 
ev'ry longing heart
Worthy is the Lamb

Worthy is the Lamb





Title: I Won't Be Ashamed


 

I won’t be ashamed 
any longer

 With You by my side 
I stand taller

My sins were erased 
now my life proclaims
I am free, I am free!


Surprised by Your grace  
and my guilt erased

Washed in Your love 
brand new I’ve become

My fears are gone

And out of the dark 
and into Your light

No longer a slave 
You broke off my chains

 And now I’m alive

Reborn now as sons 
and daughters of God


You welcomed me home
I put on your robe 

 And now I belong

So boldly I run 
before Your throne of grace
There’s no holding back 
in this place

Cause Love made a way for me and called me by name
Now I can sing 





Title: I'm Going Free (Jailbreak)




Go on and speak against my borrowed innocence
The judge is my defense
I'm going free

Right when the gavel fell
I heard the freedom bell
Ring through the heart of hell
I'm going free
I'm going free

Glory glory hallelujah
You threw my 
Shackles in the sea

Glory glory hallelujah
Jesus is my liberty
I'm going free

I won't go back again 
That's just not who I am
Lord I'm a brand new man
I'm going free

I'm on a narrow road
It's paved with 
Grace and hope
It's gonna lead me home
I'm going free
I'm going free 

I am free free indeed
I am free free indeed

We are free free indeed
We are free free indeed

Someday I'll fly away 
On Your amazing grace
Your love is my jailbreak
I'm going free





Title: In Christ Alone




In Christ alone 
my hope is found
He is my light my strength 
my song

This Cornerstone 
this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love 
What depths of peace
When fears are stilled 
when strivings cease

My Comforter my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone 
Who took on flesh
Fullness of God 
in helpless babe

This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones 
He came to save

Till on that cross 
as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied

For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of 
Christ, I live

There in the ground 
His body lay
Light of the world by
darkness slain

Then bursting forth 
in glorious Day
Up from the grave
 He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost 
It’s grip on me

For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life no fear in death
This is the power of 
Christ in me

From life's first cry 
to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell
 No scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

Till He returns or 
calls me home
Here in the power of
 Christ I'll stand





Title: In Over My Head




I have come to this 
place in my life
I'm full but I've not satisfied
This longing to have 
more of You

I can feel it my heart 
is convinced
I'm thirsty my soul 
can't be quenched
You already know this but still
Come and do 
whatever You want to

I'm standing knee deep
But I'm out 
where I've never been
I feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind

Would You come and 
tear down the boxes 
that I have tried to put You in
Let love come teach me who You are again

Take me back to the place
Where my heart was 
only about You
And all I wanted was 
just to be with You
Come and do 
whatever You want to

Further and further
My heart moves 
away from the shore
Whatever it looks like whatever may come 
I am Yours

Then You crash over me
And I've lost control 
but I'm free
I'm going under 
I'm in over my head

And You crash over me
I'm where You want me to be
I'm going under 
I'm in over my head

Whether I sink whether I swim
It makes no difference
When I'm beautifully in 
over my head

Whether I sink whether I swim
It makes no difference
When I'm beautifully in over my head

I'm beautifully in
over my head





Title: In The River


There is a river
Where goodness flows
There is a fountain
That drowns sorrow

There is an ocean
Deeper than fear
The tide is rising rising

There is a current
Stirring deep inside
It's overflowing
From the heart of God

The flood of heaven
Crashing over us
The tide is rising rising

Bursting bursting
Up from the ground 
we feel it now

Bursting bursting
Up from the ground 
we feel it now

We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river

Break open prison doors
Set all the captives free
Spring up a well 
spring up a well
Spring up a well in me

Nothing can stop this joy
We're dancing in the streets
Spring up a well 
spring up a well
Spring up a well in me

Spring up a well
Spring up a well
Spring up a well
Spring up the well
Spring up the well in me





Title: In the Secret 




In the secret in the quiet place In the stillness You are there In the secret in the quiet hour I wait only for You 
‘Cause I want to know You more 

 I want to know You 
I want to hear Your voice 
I want to know You more 
I want to touch You 
I want to see Your face 
I want to know You more 

 I am reaching for the highest goal 
That I might receive the prize Pressing onward pushing every hinderance aside 
Out of my way 
‘Cause I want to know You more 





Title: Indescribable




From the highest of heights 
to the depths of the sea

Creation's revealing 
Your majesty

From the colors of Fall 
to the fragrance of Spring

Every creature unique 
in the song that it sings
All exclaiming

Indescribable 
Uncontainable

You placed the stars 
in the sky
And You know them by name

You are amazing God

All powerful 
Untamable

Awestruck 
we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim

You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go

Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow

Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light

Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

You are amazing God

Indescribable 
Uncontainable

You placed the 
stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing God

Incomperable 
Unchangeable

You see the 
depths of my heart
And You love me the same
You are amazing God





Title: It Is Well With My Soul 




Our scars are a sign 
of grace in our lives
And Father how You 
brought us through



When deep were the wounds and dark was the night
The promise of Your love 
You proved


Now ev'ry battle still to come
Let this be our song

It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well 
it is well with my soul

Weeping may come 
remain for a night
But joy will paint 
the morning sky


You're there in the fast 
You're there in the feast
Your faithfulness 
will always shine


Now every blessing 
still to come
Let this be our song

Trust Your ways (trust Your ways)
Trust Your name (trust Your name)


It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well it is well with my soul


You lead us through battles
(You lead us through battles)
You lead us to blessing
(You lead us to blessing)

And You make us fruitful
(And You make us fruitful)
In the land of our 
suffering God
It is well it is well with my soul

It is well it is well with my soul
(It is well it is well with my soul my soul)





Title: It Is Well With My Soul




When peace like a river
Attendeth my way
When sorrows 
like sea billows roll

Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say
It is well
It is well with my soul

It is well 
with my soul
It is well
It is well with my soul

Tho' Satan should buffet
Tho' trials should come
Let this blest 
assurance control

That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood
For my soul

My sin O the bliss
Of this glorious tho't
My sin not in part 
but the whole

Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord O my soul

And Lord haste the day
When the faith shall be sight
The clouds 
be rolled back as a scroll

The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so it is well
With my soul





Title: It Is Well




Grander earth has 
quaked before
Moved by the 
sound of His voice

Seas that are 
shaken and stirred
Can be calmed and broken 
for my regard

Through it all, Through it all
My eyes are on You

Through it all through it all
It is well

Through it all through it all
My eyes are on You
It is well, with me

Far be it from me 
to not believe

Even when my eyes can't see

And this mountain 
that's in front of me

Will be thrown into 
the midst of the sea

So let go my soul
 and trust in Him

The waves and wind 
 still know His name

It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul

It is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul





Title: It's a New Day 


 

 It’s a new day 
Ev’rythings changed
When Your love came into the darkness You sent the light of the Son   
You sent the light of the Son 

 Wake up open your eyes 
No longer dead we are alive
Rise up children of light 
Open the doors go let it shine 
Woah…..


 There is freedom
In Your Kingdom
For You Jesus 
We will be dancing 

 Forever Your joy is our song 
Forever Your joy is our song 

 Song for the broken let it shine
Into the shadows let it shine
Hope for the whole world let it shine 
Let it shine 
Let it shine

Title: Jesus Loves Me




I was lost I was in chains
The world had a hold of me

My heart was a stone 
I was covered in shame
When He came for me

I couldn't run 
Couldn't run 
From His presence

I couldn't run 
Couldn't run from His arms

Jesus He loves me
He loves me He is for me

Jesus how can it be
He loves me He is for me

It was a fire deep in my soul
I'll never be the same

I stepped out of the dark 
And into the light
When He called my name

He holds the stars 
And He holds my heart
With healing hands 
That bear the scars

The rugged cross 
Where He died for me
My only hope my everything





Title: Jesus Messiah




He became sin
who knew no sin

That we might become 
His righteousness
He humbled himself and carried the cross

Love so amazing
Love so amazing

Jesus Messiah, 
name above all names
Blessed redeemer, Emmanuel

The rescue for sinners, the ransom from Heaven
Jesus Messiah, Lord of all



All our hope is in You 
All our hope is in You

All the glory to You, God, 
The light of the world

His body the bread
His blood the wine
Broken and poured out
All for love

The whole earth trembled
and the veil was torn





Title: Jesus Paid It All




And I hear the Savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all

 Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

It's washed away
All my sin and all my shame

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow
He washed it white as snow

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
(Jesus)





Title: Jesus We Love You




Old things have
passed away
Your love has
 stayed the same



Your constant grace
 remains the cornerstone
Things that we thought 
were dead
Are breathing in life again
You cause your Son to shine on darkest nights

For all that You've done we will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song

(Jesus) we love You
Oh how we love You
You are the one 
our hearts adore

Our hearts adore
Our hearts adore
Our hearts adore

The hopeless have 
found their hope
The orphans now 
have a home


All that was lost has
 found its place in You
You lift our weary head
You make us strong instead
You took these rags and made us beautiful

Our affection our devotion
Poured out on the 
feet of Jesus
(REPEAT 3X)

Jesus You love us 
Oh how You love us
We are the ones Your heart adores

There is a promise of things yet to come

our salvation

There is a light that overwhelms the darkness
There is a kingdom that forever reigns

There is freedom from the chains that bind us
Jesus
Jesus

Who walks on the waters
Who speaks to the sea
Who stands in the fire

in times of trouble
There is a song that 
comforts in the night

There is a voice that calms the storm that rages
He is Jesus Jesus

You're my rock and 
my Redeemer
There is power in Your name
In Your name

You bled as the Lamb
You carry my healing 
in Your hands

Jesus
There is no one like You
Jesus
There is no one like You

Title: Just As I Am




Just as I am 
without one plea
But that Thy blood 
was shed for me

And that Thou bidst me 
come to Thee
O Lamb of God 
I come 
I come

Just as I am 
and waiting not
To rid my soul 
of one dark blot

To Thee whose blood 
can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God 
I come 
I come

I come broken 
to be mended
I come wounded 
to be healed


I come desperate 
to be rescued
I come empty 
to be filled

I come guilty 
to be pardoned
By the blood of Christ the Lamb

And I'm welcomed 
with open arms 
praise God
Just as I am

Just as I am 
I would be lost
But mercy and grace 
my freedom bought

And now to glory 
in Your cross
O Lamb of God I come 
I come

Praise God just as I am
Just as I am

Title: Let it Echo (Heaven Fall)




We've only scratched
 the surface
And only had just 
one glance

We've tasted of Your glory
But there's so much more 

 We're standing 
on horizons
Where earth collides 
with heaven

You're longing for Your children
To cry out for more
We cry out for more


Let it echo from this city
To the nations the sound of praise 

Let the windows of the heavens
Open wide and let it rain 

Here inside Your presence
Surrounded by Your Spirit 

We're satisfied but desperate
For even more of You, even more of You
 

Oh-oh
Let heaven fall
As we sing

Oh-oh
Let heaven fall
Let heaven fall
 





Title: Light The Fire




Light the fire in my soul
Fan the flame make me whole


Lord You know 
where I've been
So light the fire 
in my heart again

I stand to praise You
But I fall to my knees
My spirit is hungry
But my flesh is so weak

Light the fire in my soul
Fan the flame make me whole


Lord You know 
where I've been
So light the fire 
in my heart again

I feel Your arms around me
As the power
Of Your healing begins


 You breathe new life
right through me 
Like a mighty  rushing wind

5It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

6But there is a place where someone has testified: 
“What is mankind that you are mindful of them, 
a son of man that you care for him?
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

7You made them a little lower than the angels; 
you crowned them with glory and honor
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

8and put everything under their feet.” 
In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

9But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

10In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

11Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

12He says, 
“I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; 
in the assembly I will sing your praises.”
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

13And again, 
“I will put my trust in him.” 
And again he says, 
“Here am I, and the children God has given me.”
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

14Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

15and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

16For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

17For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

18Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

1Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.
Hebrews 2:5-3:1 (NIV)

Bowing here I find my rest

And without You I fall apart
You're the one that guides my heart

Title: Love Changes Everything




I see His body breaking 
I see His fingers bleed
I see the darkness tremble
At the ground below His feet


And in the darkest hours there on Calvary
He was sweetly broken
Broken beautifully 
Broken beautifully

So come out into the waters
Come let the broken sing
Come all you 
sons and daughters
His love changes everything


Come when the
fear is fighting
You finding the risen king
Come on and let the light in
Your love changes everything

And when the
heavens opened
I saw the sins of men
Become a crown of glory
As You died and rose again


And in the darkest hours
And in the valley low
I will fear no evil
'Cause You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go

Your love Your love Your love changes everything
Your love Your love Your love changes everything


And none can overcome when death has lost its sting
Your love Your love Your love

And in the darkest hours
And in the valley low
I will fear no evil


You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go

Your love Your love Your love changes everything
Your love Your love Your love changes everything


Your love Your love Your love changes everything
Your love Your love Your love changes everything








Title: Love On The Line




You put Your love on the line
To bear the weight of sin 
that was mine

Washing my river of wrongs
Into the sea 
of Your infinite love

With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever

With all I am
In Your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Saviour

Mercy roars 
like hurricane winds
Furious love 
laid waste to my sin

To the One 
who has rescued my soul
To the One who has welcomed me home

To the One 
who is Saviour of all
I sing forever





Title: Majesty




Here I am
Humbled by Your majesty
Covered by Your 
grace so free

Here I am
Knowing I'm a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the Lamb

Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine

Since You laid down Your life
The greatest sacrifice

Majesty Majesty

Your grace has 
found me just as I am

Empty-handed but alive in Your hands

Here I am
Humbled by the 
love that You give
Forgiven so that I can forgive

Here I stand
Knowing that I'm Your desire
Sanctified by glory and fire

Majesty Majesty
Forever I am 
changed by Your love

In the presence
 of Your Majesty 
Majesty

Are ordained to spread 
Your fame

Made to be free

Is how you’ve called me to live
Giving honour, giving glory

This life that you gave me 
to live
Ever giving you praise
More abundantly

In song, in dance, 
In the way I live

fear turns into praises
And where You are

Let worship turn into revival

When You move 
the outcast finds a family
When You move
 the orphan finds a home


Lord here we are
oh teach us to love mercy
With humble hearts 
we bow down at Your throne

King of all generations
Let ev'ry tongue and nation
Surrender all to You alone

How can I say thanks
For the things

I owe it all to Thee

To God be the glory

To God be the glory
For the things He has done



With His blood

With His power

oh Your blood in crimson streams

oh Your death is hell's defeat

a cross meant to kill is my victory

who takes away our sin

the holy Lamb of God

Title: No Longer Slaves


 

You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song

Of deliverance from 
my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my Mother's womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name

I've been born again into 
Your family
Your blood flows 
through my veins

You split the sea so I could walk right through it

My fears were drowned in perfect love

You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God

I am surrounded by the arms of the Father
I am surrounded by the songs of deliverance 

We’ve been liberated from our bondage
We’re the sons and the daughters  

Let us sing our freedom 





Title: No Other Like You (We Will Exalt You)

Broken and You bore our sins
Laid Your life down


Through the sacrifice 
of Your Son
The power of 
death was overcome
Laid Your life down 
on the cross

There's no other like You
Nothing compares to 
Your great love


Highly exalted 
forever seated on the throne

We stand in awe of You
We stand in awe of You
Nothing else compares God
We stand in awe of You

By the blood of Christ 
we boldly come
All of heaven welcomes us
Lord we thank You 
for the cross

We will exalt You

Title: No Other Name




One Name
Holds weight above them all
His fame
Outlasts the earth He formed

His praise
Resounds beyond the stars
And echoes in our hearts
The greatest One of all

His face
Shines brighter than the sun
His grace
As boundless as His love

He reigns
With healing in His wings
The King above all kings
The greatest One of all

Lift up our eyes 
see the King has come
Light of the world
Reaching out for us

There is no other Name
There is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God 

Seated on high the undefeated One
Mountains bow down 
as we lift Him up

There is no other Name
There is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God oh

Find hope
When all the world seems lost
Behold
The triumph of the cross

His power has trampled 
death and grave
Our life found in His Name
The greatest Name of all

The earth will shake
And tremble before Him
Chains will break
As heaven and earth sing


Holy is the Name
Holy is the Name of Jesus Jesus Jesus





Title: None But Jesus




In the quiet in the stillness
I know that You are God

In the secret 
of Your presence
I know there I am restored

When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

There is no one else for me
None but Jesus

Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

In the chaos in confusion
I know You're sovereign still

In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace 
to do Your will

When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

All my delight is 
in You Lord

All of my hope
All of my strength

All my delight is 
in You Lord
Forevermore





Title: Nothing But The Blood (Plainfield)




What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus

What can make me 
Whole again
Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus

O precious is the flow
That makes me
 white as snow

No other fount I know
Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus

Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus





Title: Nothing I Hold Onto




I lean not on my own understanding
My life is in the hands of the maker of heaven

I give it all to You God
Trusting that You'll make
Something beautiful 
out of me

Oh yeah

I will climb this mountain
With my hands wide open
(REPEAT)

There's nothing I hold onto
There's nothing I hold onto

I am so in Love with you
There is no one else for me 





Title: O Come All Ye Faithful


O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye O come ye

Born the King of angels 

O come let us adore Him

Title: O Come O Come Emmanuel (Veni Emmanuel)




O come O come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel

That mourns in lonely 
exile here
Until the Son of God appear

O come Thou Dayspring come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine 
advent here

Disperse the gloomy
 clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

O come Desire of 
nations bind
All peoples in one 
heart and mind

Bid envy strife and 
quarrels cease
Fill the whole world with heaven's peace





Title: O Come To The Altar




Are you hurting 
and broken within

Overwhelmed by the 
weight of your sin
Jesus is calling

Have you come 
to the end of yourself

Do you thirst for 
a drink from the well
Jesus is calling

O come to the altar
The Father's arms 
are open wide

Forgiveness 
was bought with
The precious blood 
of Jesus Christ

Leave behind your 
regrets and mistakes

Come today 
there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling

Bring your sorrows 
and trade them for joy

From the ashes 
a new life is born
Jesus is calling

Oh what a Savior
Isn't he wonderful
Sing alleluia Christ is risen

Bow down before him
For he is Lord of all
Sing alleluia Christ is risen

Bear your cross 
as you wait for the crown

Tell the world of the treasure you've found





Title: O Holy Night


O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth


Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
  

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine


O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night 
O night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace



 Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease

 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
O praise His name forever


His power and glory
Evermore proclaim
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim 





Title: O Praise The Name (Anástasis)




I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled 
and died for me

I see His wounds 
His hands His feet
My Saviour on 
that cursed tree

His body bound 
and drenched in tears
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb

The entrance sealed 
by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore

For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord 
oh Lord our God

Then on the third 
at break of dawn
The Son of heaven rose again

O trampled death 
where is your sting
The angels roar 
for Christ the King

He shall return 
in robes of white
The blazing sun 
shall pierce the night

And I will rise 
among the saints
My gaze transfixed 
on Jesus' face





Title: Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)




You call me out 
upon the waters
The great unknown 
where feet may fail

And there I find You 
in the mystery
In oceans deep 
my faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above 
the waves

When oceans rise
My soul will rest 
in Your embrace
For I am Yours 
and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sov'reign hand 
will be my guide

Where feet may fail 
and fear surrounds me
You've never failed 
and You won't start now

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me

Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith 
will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour





Title: Oh Lord You're Beautiful




Oh Lord You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek


For when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me

I want to take Your Word
And shine it all around
First help me just 
to live it Lord


And when I'm doing well
Help me to never 
seek a crown


For my reward is 
giving glory to You

Oh Lord please light the fire
That once burned 
bright and clear


Replace the lamp of 
my first love
That burns with
holy fear





Title: Once Again




Jesus Christ
I think upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing
Poured out to death

Many times I've wondered
At Your gift of life
And I'm in that place 
Once again

I'm in that place 
Once again

Once again
I look upon the cross
Where You died

I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside

Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life

Now You are
Exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens
Where one day I'll bow

But for now
I marvel at this saving grace
And I'm full of praise 
Once again

I'm full of praise once again

Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross 
My Friend

Once again
I look upon the cross
Where You died

I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside

Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life

Once again
I look upon the cross
Where You died

I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside

Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life

Higher than the mountains That I face
Stronger than 
The power of the grave

And the change

Title: Raise A Hallelujah





 I raise a hallelujah 
in the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah 
louder than the unbelief


 I raise a hallelujah 
My weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah 
Heaven comes to fight for me

I’m gonna sing 
in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder 
you’re gonna hear my praises roar

Up from the ashes 
hope will arise
Death is defeated 
the King is alive

I raise a hallelujah 
with everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah 
I will watch the darkness flee


I raise a hallelujah 
in the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah 
fear you lost your hold on me

Sing a little louder 
(Sing a little louder)
(x4)

Sing a little louder 
(in the presence of my enemies)
Sing a little louder 
(louder than the unbelief)
Sing a little louder 
(my weapon is a melody)
Sing a little louder 
(Heaven comes to fight for me)
(REPEAT)

I raise a hallelujah
(Repeat)





Title: Reason


Upon a hill far away
The Lamb of God was slain
Upon the cross
His nail pierced hands
No drop of blood in vain

I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship
I have a reason to 
lift my hands in praise

It’s a new season
It’s a new day
The new has come
let the old pass away

For death has been vanquished
The battle’s been won
The work has been finished
through Christ the Son

 I know You’re not finished
with this old jar of clay
For You’re pouring new wine 
into me today




 Now I walk in freedom
I’m a child of God
Through Christ my Saviour
Christ my God



Oh You don’t grow weary
oh You never stop
You never grow stagnant
and You don’t give up



You hear my prayers
cause You love your child
Your love is faithful
and Your love is wild



The Son of God 
gave up His life
That I might truly live
The price that I 
could never pay 
The Father freely gave

But on the Third
at break of dawn
Breath filled his lungs again
Death’s icy grip 
could not restrain
the Author of life had won


I have a reason to live
I have a reason to be here
I have a reason to show
this world Your glory






Title: Reckless Love




Before I spoke a word 
You were singing over me

You have been 
so so good to me

Before I took a breath 
You breathed Your life in me

You have been 
so so kind to me

Oh the overwhelming 
never-ending 
reckless love of God

Oh it chases me down 
fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it 
I don't deserve
Still You give Yourself away

Oh the overwhelming 
never-ending 
reckless love of God

When I was Your foe 
still Your love fought for me

You have been 
so so good to me

When I felt no worth 
You paid it all for me

You have been 
so so kind to me

There's no shadow 
You won't light up

Mountain You 
won't climb up
Coming after me

There's no wall 
You won't kick down

Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me







Title: Relentless




Salvation sounds 
a new beginning
As distant hearts 
begin believing

Redemption's bid 
is unrelenting
Your love goes on
Your love goes on

You carry us carry us
When the world gives way
You cover us cover us
With Your endless grace

Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless

The time is up 
for chasing shadows
You gave the world 
a light to follow

A hope that shines 
beyond tomorrow
Your love goes on
Your love goes on

Tearing through 
the veil of darkness
Breaking every chain
You set us free

Fighting for the furthest heart
You gave Your life 
for all to see

Tearing through 
the veil of darkness
Breaking every chain
You set us free

Fighting for the furthest heart
You gave Your life
Your love is relentless

Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless





Title: Repentant Heart




 I’m turning back to you

Too long have my eyes
Been on myself
Foolishly trying to figure it out
For only against you have I sinned
Your grace is sufficient for me

When you look at me
may your eyes always see
a repentant heart

For your glory 
not my will but Yours be done
I surrender everything 
to the only worthy King





Title: Resurrecting




The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now

The Saviour knelt to 
wash our feet
Now at his feet we bow

The one who wore our 
sin and shame
Now robed in majesty

The radiance of perfect love
Now shines for all to see

Your name, Your name
Is victory
All praise will rise
To Christ our King
(Repeat)

The fear that held us 
Now gives way
To him who is our peace

His final breath 
Upon the cross
Is now alive in me

By Your spirit I will rise
From the ashes of defeat
The resurrected King
Is resurrecting me

In Your name I come alive
To declare Your victory
The resurrected King
Is resurrecting me

The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
Was borrowed for three days

His body there 
Would not remain
Our God has 
Robbed the grave
Our God has
Robbed the grave 

Yours is the kingdom 
Yours is the power 
Yours is the glory 
Forever Amen 





Title: Resurrection Power




You called me from 
the grave by name
You called me out 
of all my shame


I see the old 
has passed away
The new has come

Now I have 
resurrection power 
living on the inside
Jesus 
You have given us freedom


No longer bound by
 sin and darkness
You have given us freedom
You have given us freedom

I'm dressed in Your royalty
Your Holy Spirit lives in me
I see my past
 has been redeemed
The new has come

Freedom You have 
given us freedom
You have given us freedom
My chains are gone


Freedom You have
given us freedom
You have given us freedom
Hallelujah

Now I have 
resurrection power
Living on the inside


Now no longer 
bound by sin and darkness
Living in the light 
of Your goodness
You have given us freedom

coming up to my chest
and it’s flooding over me

Let the river flow
Let it flood
Over us
Let the river flow
Let it flood

 In Your presence
This is fullness of joy

Title: Scripture




1Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

2He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

3Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

4For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

5“Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,” bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

6But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

7So, as the Holy Spirit says: 
“Today, if you hear his voice,
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

8do not harden your hearts 
as you did in the rebellion, 
during the time of testing in the wilderness,
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

9where your ancestors tested and tried me, 
though for forty years they saw what I did.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

10That is why I was angry with that generation; 
I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, 
and they have not known my ways.’
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

11So I declared on oath in my anger, 
‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

12See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

13But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

14We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

15As has just been said: 
“Today, if you hear his voice, 
do not harden your hearts 
as you did in the rebellion.”
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

16Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

17And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

18And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

19So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)

1Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
Hebrews 3:1-4:1 (NIV)



12For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
Hebrews 4:12-13 (NIV)

13Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
Hebrews 4:12-13 (NIV)



8Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
Philippians 4:8-9 (NIV)

9Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
Philippians 4:8-9 (NIV)





Title: Search my Heart


Search my heart,
Show me where
I’ve gone astray
Help me to follow your way
Jesus 

Come and do
All that you’ve wanted to do in me,
Be who you’ve wanted to be in me,
Jesus

 For life is worth living
when it’s lived for you
And air is worth breathing
when it’s breathed for you

 And all that’s within me
cries out
I know I can’t do this without
I just want to know you

 You don’t want a piece, no you don’t want a share
You want my whole heart laid bare

 Take my heart, I give you what’s already yours
To do in me something far more
Jesus

 Break my heart, for all that is breaking in your heart
Give me the strength to fight on,
Jesus

other locusts have eaten.

6A nation has invaded my land, 
a mighty army without number; 
it has the teeth of a lion, 
the fangs of a lioness.
Joel 1:1-12 (NIV)

7It has laid waste my vines 
and ruined my fig trees. 
It has stripped off their bark 
and thrown it away, 
leaving their branches white.
Joel 1:1-12 (NIV)

8Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth

wail, you vine growers;

with fasting and weeping and mourning.”

even among the survivors 
whom the LORD calls.

Stirred by grace
 And all my heart is Yours

All fear removed
I breathe You in 
I lean into Your love
Oh, Your love

When I'm lost You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all so beautiful

Here in You I find shelter
Captivated by the 
splendour of Your face

Washing over me
Your face is all I seek

Title: So Will I (100 Billion X)


God of creation
There at the start before the beginning of time
With no point of ref'rence
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light

And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I

I can see Your heart in ev'rything You've made
Ev'ry burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Chasing after every word You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I

I can see Your heart in ev'rything You say
Ev'ry painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I
So will I ooh ooh

If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in rev'rence so will I

If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if ev'rything exists to lift You high so will I

If the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I

If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created the light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I

I can see Your heart in ev'rything You've done
Ev'ry part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I

I can see Your heart eight billion diff'rent ways
Ev'ry precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

Title: Spirit Lead Me


This is my worship this is my offering
In every moment I withhold nothing
I'm learning to trust You even when I can't see it
Even in suffering I have to believe it

If You say it's wrong then I'll say no
If You say release I'm letting go
If You're in it with me I'll begin
And when You say to jump I'm diving in
If You say be still then I will wait
If You say to trust I will obey
I don't wanna follow my own way
I'm done chasing feelings
Spirit lead me

It felt like a burden but once I could grasp it
You took me further further then I was asking
Simply to see You it's worth it all
My life is an altar let Your fire fall

If You say it's wrong then I'll say no
If You say release I'm letting go
If You're in it with me I'll begin
And when You say to jump I'm diving in
If You say be still then I will wait
If You say to trust I will obey
Teach me how to follow in Your way
I'm done chasing feelings
Spirit lead me

When all hope is gone and Your Word is all I got
I have to believe
You still bring water from the rocks
To satisfy my thirst to love me at my worst
And even when I don't remember
You remind me of my worth
I don't trust my ways I'm trading in my thoughts
I'd lay down everything
'Cause You're all that I want
I've landed on my knees
This is the cup You have for me
And even when it don't make sense
I'm gonna let Your Spirit lead
Spirit lead me Spirit lead me
Spirit lead me Spirit lead me

If You say it's wrong then I'll say no
If You say release I'm letting go
If You're in it with me I'll begin
And when You say to jump I'm diving in
If You say be still then I will wait
If You say to trust I will obey
You're the only Truth The Life The Way
I'm done chasing feelings
Spirit lead me
Spirit lead me
Spirit lead me
Spirit lead me
Spirit lead me

12Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Philippians 3:12 (NIV)

7But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
2 Corinthians 4:7-8 (NIV)

8We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
2 Corinthians 4:7-8 (NIV)

16Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (NIV)

17For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (NIV)

18So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (NIV)

1And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
1 Corinthians 2:1-5 (NIV)

2For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
1 Corinthians 2:1-5 (NIV)

3I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.
1 Corinthians 2:1-5 (NIV)

4My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,
1 Corinthians 2:1-5 (NIV)

5so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.
1 Corinthians 2:1-5 (NIV)

7But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
Philippians 3:7-9 (NIV)

8What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ
Philippians 3:7-9 (NIV)

9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.
Philippians 3:7-9 (NIV)

7I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
2 Timothy 4:7 (NIV)

12Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Philippians 3:12 (NIV)

Title: Surrounded (Fight My Battles)




There's a table that You've prepared for me
In the presence 
of my enemies


It's Your body and Your blood You shed for me
This is how I fight my battles

And I believe 
You've overcome
And I will lift my song of praise for all You've done

This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
At Your Table


In the valley I know that You're with me
And surely Your goodness and Your mercy follow me


So my weapons are
praise and thanksgiving
This is how I fight my battles

It may look
like I'm surrounded
But I'm surrounded by You
It may look 
like I'm surrounded
But I'm surrounded by You

My victory's in Jesus' name
(My victory's in Jesus' name)
My victory's in Jesus' name
(My victory's in Jesus' name)

Nothing is as strong as
 Your blood

Title: Thank you 




 No sin and no force of darkness
Can stand in the way of the 
love of our God


 For the power of sin
was utterly broken
By the power of your blood
that was shed on the cross

Thank you 
Thank you my King
Lord accept this offering 
I give you my heart 
and all my life
For You alone are worthy

 As the dawn of the sun 
on the third day
The tomb was found empty, 
where Jesus laid


For death could not hold
the author of life
He is risen
He is risen indeed


Jesus, Jesus
How we adore you
King of Glory
Jesus we worship You
Jesus we honour You
Jesus we love You

Thank you 
Thank you my King
For  yours is the victory
The Spirit who raised our Lord 
from the grave
Is living inside of me





Title: The Heart Of Worship




When the music fades 
all is stripped away
And I simply come

Longing just to bring something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself is not what You have required

You search much 
deeper within
Through the way 
things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the 
heart of worship

And it's all about You
 all about You Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the 
thing I've made it

When it's all about You all about You Jesus

King of endless worth
 no one could express
How much You deserve

Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Yours
Every single breath





Title: The Lion And The Lamb




He's coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms 
will bow down

And every chain will break
As broken hearts 
declare His praise

For who can stop 
the Lord almighty

Our God is the Lion
The Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power
And fighting our battles

And every knee will bow before Him

Our God is the Lamb
The Lamb that was slain
For the sin of the world
His blood breaks the chains

And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
Oh every knee will bow 
before Him

So open up the gates
Make way before 
the King of kings

Our God who comes to save
Is here to set the captives free
For who can stop 
the Lord almighty

Who can stop 
the Lord almighty 






Title: The Same Love




You choose the humble
and raise them high
You choose the weak and make them strong


You heal our 
brokenness inside
And give us life

The same love that 
set the captives free
The same love that 
opened eyes to see


Is calling us all by name
You are calling us all by name


The same God that 
spread the heavens wide
The same God 
that was crucified


Is calling us all by name
You are calling us all by name

You take the 
faithless one aside
And speak the words 
you are Mine
You call the cynic 
and the proud
Come to Me now

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

You're calling You're calling
You're calling us to the cross
You're calling You're calling
You're calling us to the cross
(REPEAT)





Title: The Secret Place


Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running I'm running
I'm running to the secret place

Where will you run my soul
Where will you go when wells run dry
When the wind starts to blow
How you gonna keep this flame alive

In the fading light when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there

(I'm) running to the secret place
Where You are where You are
I'll sing to You all the ways
You stole my heart stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running I'm running
I'm running to the secret place

You are my only hope
You are the Rock on which I stand
You will not let me go
I know that I'm safe inside Your hands

Hands are lifted high hearts awake to life
We are satisfied here with You here with You
Chains will hit the floor broken lives restored
We couldn't ask for more here with You here with You





Title: The Stand 




You stood before creation
Eternity in your hand

You spoke the earth 
into motion
My soul now to stand

 You stood before 
my failure
And carried the cross 
for my shame

 My sin weighed 
upon your shoulders
My soul now to stand

So what could I say
And what could I do

 But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

So I'll walk upon salvation
Your spirit alive in me

This life to declare 
your promise
My soul now to stand 

I'll stand
With arms high 
and heart abandoned
In awe of the one 
who gave it all

I'll stand
My soul Lord to you surrendered
All, I am is yours





Title: The Stand (Chorus)






So I'll stand
With arms high 
and heart abandoned
In awe of the One 
Who gave it all

I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours





Title: The Steadfast Love




The steadfast love
of the Lord never ceases
His mercies never 
come to an end


They are new every morning
new every morning
Great is Thy Faithfulness o Lord
Great is Thy Faithfulness

The Lord is my portion
Says my soul
Therefore I will hope in Him

The Lord is good
To those who wait for Him
To the soul that seeks Him


It is good that we 
should wait quietly
For the salvation of the Lord

The Lord will not
cast off for ever
But will have compassion
For He does 
not willingly afflict
Or grieve the sons of men

So let us examine
 all our ways
And return to the Lord
Let us lift up our 
hearts and hands
To God in heaven





Title: The Wonderful Cross




When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

O the wonderful cross
O the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
That I may truly live


O the wonderful cross
O the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace
Draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all





Title: There Is A Name




There is a name
Who reigns without contention
Whose power can’t be questioned
 or contained


With humble fame
He rules the earth and heavens
His glory knows no 
measure or refrain
And it’s bursting past 
the border lines of space

Jesus
Enthroned upon the 
praises of our hearts
Jesus
You’re the King and 
You’re the center of it all

There is a name reaching 
past the margins
Calling sons and daughters 
back to Him


and as He saves
We can hear the roar of Heaven
As prodigals are 
coming home again
Oh the triumph of 
His name will never end

For every eye will see
Every heart will know
There is no name above 
the name of Jesus


Death could not hold Him down
No grave could keep Him bound
All sin and sickness 
bow to the name of Jesus





Title: There Is None Like You




There is none like You
No one else can touch
My heart like You do


I could search
For all eternity long and find
There is none like You

Your mercy flows 
like a river wide
And healing comes 
from Your hands


Suffering children are 
safe in Your arms
There is none like You





Title: This I Believe (The Creed)




Our Father everlasting 
The all creating One 
God almighty

Conceiving Christ the Son

I believe in the resurrection That we will rise again 
For I believe in the 
Name of Jesus  

Our Judge and our defender Suffered and crucified Forgiveness is in You 

Descended into darkness 
you rose in glorious life Forever seated high   

I believe in You 
I believe You rose again

Is Lord  

I believe in life eternal 
I believe in the virgin birth 
I believe in the saint’s communion 
And in Your holy Church  

I believe in the resurrection When Jesus comes again
For I believe 
In the Name of Jesus  





Title: This Is Amazing Grace




Who breaks the power 
Of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty 
And so much stronger

The King of Glory 
The King above all kings

Who shakes the whole earth 
With holy thunder
Who leaves us breathless 
In awe and wonder

The King of Glory the King above all kings

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross

You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh Jesus I sing for 
All that You've done for me

Who brings our chaos 
Back into order
Who makes the orphan 
A son and daughter

The King of Glory 
The King of Glory

Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in 
All of its brilliance

The King of Glory 
The King above all kings

Worthy is the Lamb 
Who was slain
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy

Worthy is the Lamb 
Who was slain
Worthy is the King who Conquered the grave





Title: This is how I Fight my Battles




This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles

At Your table



It may look like I'm surrounded 
but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded 
but I'm surrounded by You

This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles

At Your table



Nothing is as strong as Your blood
Nothing is as strong as Your blood
Nothing is as strong as Your blood
Nothing is as strong as Your blood!


This is how I fight my battle
Right here at the table


Your blood and 
Your body has overcome!
Your blood and 
Your body has overcome!





Title: This Is Our God




Your grace is enough
More than I need
At Your word I will believe

I wait for You
Draw near again
Let Your Spirit make me new

And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here

Your presence in me
Jesus light the way
By the power of Your word

I am restored
I am redeemed
By Your Spirit I am free

Freely You gave it all for us
Surrendered Your life 
upon that cross

Great is the love 
poured out for all
This is our God

Lifted on high 
from death to life
Forever our God is glorified

Servant and King 
rescued the world
This is our God





Title: This is what it looks like








                                   God you’re so good

 Blind eyes were opened
Deaf ears they heard again
Lost souls their hope was being restored

 Lame men they walked again
Dead men they lived again
Outcasts were honoured
and adored 

This is what it looks like
When the Saviour 
of the world
walks in our midst


This is what it feels like 
When the God of all this earth
comes in His power

 His body it was broken
Whipped bruised and beaten
Hung on a cross
 and left to die

 My sin held Him up there 
His blood paid the ransom
Because of His stripes 
I have been healed

Halle-Hallelujah 
Halle-Hallelujah
Halle-Hallelujah

And then on the third day
They found the 
stone rolled away
The grave could not keep our Saviour in

Now death has been beaten
We’ve been given freedom
Jesus has paid the 
price for sin

 Who is this man?
He’s different than all who came before Him
walking with humility
even the children
they adore Him

Who is this man?
Glory and power 
go before Him
Speaking with authority
even the 
Angels bow before Him





Title: This We Know




You are 
who You say You are
You'll do 
what You say You'll do

You'll be 
who You've always 
been to us
Jesus

Our hope 
is in You alone
Our strength 
in Your mighty name

Our peace 
in the darkest day remains
Jesus

This we know
We will see the enemy run
This we know
We will see the victory come

We hold on to every promise You ever made
Jesus You are unfailing

Our guide 
through the wilderness
Our joy 
in the heaviness

Our way 
when it seems 
there is no way
Jesus

We trust You
We trust You
Your ways 
are higher than our own





Title: Thrive




Here in this 
Worn and weary land
Where many a dream 
has died 

Like a tree planted 
by the water
We never will run dry

So living water 
Flowing through
God we thirst for 
More of You

Fill our hearts and 
Flood our souls
With one desire

Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your 
name on High

Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide

We know we were made for 
so much more
Than ordinary lives  

It's time for us to 
more than just survive
We were 
made to thrive



Into Your word 
we're digging deep
To know 
our Father's heart

Into the world 
we're reaching out
To show them 
who You are

Joy Unspeakable, Faith Unsinkable, Love Unstoppable, Anything is possible





Title: To Our God




Up from the ashes
Your love has brought us
Out of the darkness 
and into the light
Lifting our sorrows
Bearing our burdens
Healing our hearts

To our God we lift up one voice
To our God we lift up one song
To our God we lift up one voice
Singing hallelujah

Chains have been broken
Eyes have been opened
An army of dry bones 
is starting to rise
Death is defeated
We are victorious
For You are alive

Hallelujah
Singing hallelujah
Hallelujah
Singing hallelujah
Hallelujah
Singing hallelujah
Hallelujah

Make His praise
Glorious glorious glorious
For His name is
Glorious glorious glorious
Make His praise

Knowing that all You have in store for me is good
It's good

I will stand upon Your truth

And all my days I'll live for You
(All my days I'll live for You)

Today is the day You have made

I will rejoice and be glad in it


And I won't worry about tomorrow
I'm giving You my fears and sorrows
Where You lead me I will follow
I'm trusting in what You say
Today is the day





Title: Touch The Sky


What fortune lies 
beyond the stars
Those dazzling heights 
too vast to climb

I got so high to fall so far
But I found heaven
 as love swept low

My heart beating 
 My soul breathing
I found my life 
when I laid it down

Upward falling spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

What treasure waits 
within Your scars
This gift of freedom 
gold can't buy

I bought the world 
and sold my heart
You traded heaven
 to have me again

Find me here 
At Your feet again
Ev'rything I am
 Reaching out I surrender

Come sweep me up
In Your love again
And my soul will dance 
On the wings of forever

Upward falling spirit soaring
I touch the sky 
When my knees hit the ground





Title: Trading My Sorrows




I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord

I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord

Yes Lord yes Lord 
yes yes Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord 
yes yes Lord

Yes Lord yes Lord 
yes yes Lord amen

I am pressed 
but not crushed
Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down 
but not destroyed

I am blessed beyond 
the curse
For His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna 
be my strength

Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes 
with the morning





Title: Tremble




Peace bring it all to peace
The storms surrounding me
Let it break at Your name

Still call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave at Your name

Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus You silence fear


Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus

Breathe 
call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing
Once again I will praise

Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus You silence fear


Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus

Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus You silence fear


Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus

Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome


Your name is alive 
forever lifted high
Your name 
cannot be overcome

Jesus Jesus You make the darkness tremble
Jesus Jesus You silence fear


Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the Power
Yours is the glory forever
Amen





Title: Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus




O soul are you weary and troubled
No light in the darkness you see
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in 
His wonderful face

And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His 
glory and grace

Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are

His Word shall not fail you He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell





Title: Unchanging




Great is Your faithfulness

You never change 
You never fail O God

True are Your promises
You never change

So we raise up holy hands
To praise the Holy One

up holy hands
To praise the Holy One
Who was and is 
and is to come

Wide is Your love and grace
Wide is Your love and grace
You never change 
You never fail O God

You were You are
You will always be
You were You are 
You will always be





Title: Unstoppable God




 Heaven thundered
and the world was born

Life begins and ends
in the dust you formed

Faith commanded
and the mountains moved 

Fear is losing ground
to our hope in you

Unstoppable God 
let Your glory go, on and on 

Impossible things 
in Your name 
they shall be done

Freedom conquered
all our chains undone

Sin defeated
Jesus has overcome 

Mercy triumphed 
when the third day dawned 

Darkness was denied 
when the stone was gone



Nothing shall be impossible
Your kingdom reigns unstoppable

We’ll Shout Your praise forevermore
Jesus our God unstoppable 





Title: Thank you 




You’re the Alpha & Omega
The beginning and the end
(x4)
And all my hope is in you alone

 No sin and no force of darkness
Can stand in the way of the 
love of our God

was utterly broken
By the power of 
your blood
that was shed on the cross

Thank you 
Thank you my King

I give you my heart 
and all of my life
For You alone are worthy

Heaven's angels all around

My delight is found 
in knowing
That You wear the 
victor's crown

You're my help 
and my defender
You're my Saviour 
and my friend

By Your grace I live and breathe to worship You

At the mention of 
Your greatness
In Your Name 
I will bow down

In Your Presence fear is silent
For You wear 
the victor's crown

Let Your glory fill this temple
Let Your power overflow
By Your grace I live and breathe to worship You

Hallelujah 
You have overcome
You have overcome

Hallelujah Jesus You have overcome the world

You are ever interceding
As the lost become the found

You can never be defeated
For You wear 
the victor's crown

You are Jesus the Messiah
You're the Hope 
of all the world

By Your grace I live and breathe to worship You

Every high thing 
must come down
Every stronghold 
shall be broken

You wear the victor's crown
You overcome 
You overcome

At the cross the work 
was finished
You were buried 
in the ground

But the grave could not contain You
For You wear 
the victor's crown

20Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

21But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

22This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

24and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

25God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

26he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
Romans 3:20-26 (NIV)

1What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter?
Romans 4:1-4 (NIV)

2If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God.
Romans 4:1-4 (NIV)

3What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
Romans 4:1-4 (NIV)

4Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.
Romans 4:1-4 (NIV)

13It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

14For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

15because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

16Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

17As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

18Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

19Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

20Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

21being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

22This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

23The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone,
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

24but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
Romans 4:13-24 (NIV)

Title: What A Friend We Have In Jesus (Blaenwern)




What a friend
we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer


O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless
 pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptations
Is there trouble anywhere
We should never 
be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer


Can we find a friend
 so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our 
every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care
Precious Savior
 still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer


Do thy friends despise forsake thee
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take 
and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there

Jesus 
O what a friend
we have 
in Jesus

Title: When You Walk Into The Room




When You walk into the room
Everything changes
Darkness starts to tremble
At the light that You bring

When You walk into the room
Every heart starts burning
And nothing matters more 
than just to sit here 
at Your feet and worship You

We love You 
and we'll never stop
We can't live without You Jesus

We love You 
We can't get enough
All this is for You 
Jesus

When You walk into the room
Sickness starts to vanish
Every hopeless situation
Ceases to exist

When You walk into the room
The dead begin to rise
'Cause there 
is resurrection life
In all You do

Come and consume 
God all we are
We give You permission 
Our hearts are Yours
We want You 
We want You

Title: Who Am I




Who am I that the 
Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt

Who am I that the 
Bright and Morning Star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wand'ring heart

Not because of 
who I am
But because of 
what You've done

Not because of 
what I've done
But because of 
who You are 

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today 
and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind

Still You hear me 
when I'm calling
Lord You catch me 
when I'm falling


And You've told me 
who I am
I am Yours

Who am I that the eyes 
that see my sin
Would look on me with love
And watch me rise again

Who am I that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out 
through the rain
And calm the storm in me





Title: Who You Say I Am




Who am I that 
the highest King
Would welcome me


I was lost but 
He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me

Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

Free at last
He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me

I am chosen not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me 
not against me
I am who You say I am


(Oh) (Yes) I am who
 You say I am





Title: Whom Shall I fear




You hear me when I call
You are my morning song

Though Darkness 
fills the night 
It cannot hide the light

Whom shall I fear

You crush the enemy 
underneath my feet

You are my sword and shield
Though troubles linger still

Whom shall I fear 

 I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind

 The God of angel armies Is always by side

 The one who reigns forever He is a friend of mine

 The God of angel armies Is always by side

My strength is in Your name, for You alone can save 

You will deliver me, Yours is the victory 

Whom shall I fear
Whom shall I fear

And nothing formed against me shall stand

You hold the whole world in Your hands

I’m holding on to Your Promises

You are faithful 
Your Are faithful

You are faithful 
Your Are faithful
You are faithful 

The God of angel armies is always by my side







Title: Wild & Crazy 






You stepped into 
my darkest night
With freedom sparkling 
in your eyes


My shadow fled 
the dancing light
all that was dead
came back to light


An now, I can see
I see you clearly
Your drowning the grey 
of fear in brilliant colour

Your love is wild
it’s crazy
It doesn’t stop
It doesn’t end

Your love is for me 
it’s not against me
It doesn’t stop
it doesn’t end

You chase, chase me down
with freedom all around
I throw caution to the wind
and I celebrate you

It’s greater than guilt
louder than shame
This reckless love
 will never be tamed

Your passionate heart 
can never be bound
demons will flee and
heaven will shout

That nothing is as 
strong as your love
nothing is as strong as your love
nothing is as strong as your love
nothing is as strong as your love

I’ll never know what it feels like to not be loved





Title: Worthy Of It All




All the saints and angels
They bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns
Before the Lamb of God and sing

You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory

Day and night night and day 
let incense arise
Day and night night and day 
let incense arise
Day and night night and day 
let incense arise
Day and night night and day 
let incense arise

Oh oh oh oh





Title: Worthy of your name




Rumours of the Son of man
Stories of a Saviour  
Holiness with human hands
Treasure for the Traitor


No ear had heard 
No eye had seen 
The Image of the Father

Until heaven came 
to live with me 
A rescue like no other

You are worthy
You are worthy of Your name
You are worthy
You are worthy of Your name
Jesus 

You did not speak 
You made no sound 
You died for your accusers

As Your blood 
fell to the ground
You redefined my future 

And on the day 
that You arose 
The darkness ran for cover


For the King of kings 
has claimed His throne
Now until forever 

You’re my author
My maker
My ransom
My saviour 
My refuge
My hiding place 

You’re my helper 
My healer
My blessed redeemer
My answer
My saving grace 

You're my hope 
in the shadows
My strength in the battle
My anchor for all my days

You stand by my side
And you stood in my place
Jesus no other name
Jesus no other name

Title: You Came (Lazarus)




You stood outside my grave
With tears still on Your face

I heard You say my name
My night was turned to day

You came 
I knew that You would come

You sang 
My heart it woke up

I'm not afraid 
I see Your face 
I am alive

You came
I knew that You would come

You said death's 
only sleeping

With one word my heart 
was beating

I rose up from my grave
My fear was turned to faith

You are 
A miracle-working God

You turn my fear into faith
You raise me 
up from the grave





Title: You Found Me




My eyes 
have seen the Risen One
Shining like the sun
He came to rescue me
The curse
 of sin and shame are done
Death was overcome 
the day He came for me

Now I have a song to sing
I was lost then
 Jesus You found me
Now I live
 forever free
I was lost 
then Jesus You found me

The cross 
standing in my place
Ev'ry debt is paid
I stand in victory
The curse 
of sin and shame are done
Death was overcome 
the day He came for me

You are my God
 and I will praise You
 praise You
For all You've done 
yes I will praise You
You are my God and I exalt You exalt You
For all You've done

Distant shores and the islands will see
Your light as it rises on us

Like water the sea


You said lift up your eyes
The harvest is here the kingdom is near

O Lord I ask for the nations

Consuming fire fan into flame
A passion for Your name

fall in this place

Stir it up in our hearts
A passion for Your name

Title: Your love never fails




Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails

I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies 
for me everyday
Your love never fails

You stay the same 
Through the ages
Your love never changes

There maybe pain in the night But joy comes in the morning

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid

Because I know 
That You love me
Your love never fails 

You make, all things, work together for my good

The wind is strong 
And the water's deep

But I'm not alone 
In these open seas
Cause Your love never fails   

The chasm is far too wide
I never thought 
I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails





Title: Your Love O Lord


Your love O Lord
Reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness
Stretches to the sky


Your righteousness
Is like the mighty mountains
Your justice flows
Like the ocean's tide

I will lift my voice
To worship You my King
I will find my strength
In the shadow of Your wings

Your love O Lord
Reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness
Stretches to the sky





Title: Your Name (Chorus)

You inspire songs of praise

'Cause nothing has the
 power to save
But Your Name
